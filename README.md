![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/spyker77/jelly/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg?branch=main)

The project is 80-90% built using AI tools as an experiment to see how this new way of solving software engineering problems can be incorporated into a traditional workflow, how it will impact developer productivity, and what this could mean for the future of programming.

## Quick Start

Spin up the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open in your browser to see the GraphiQL: <http://localhost:8000/graphql>
